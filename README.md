# Time Dependence Counter

This mod adds a counter that shows how "time dependent" your cuts are, on a scale from 0-1. 

"Time Dependent" refers to the how different your cut score would be if you hit the block earlier or later in time. 0 Indicatives a completely time independent cut and 1 indicates a completely time dependent cut.

The time dependence is measured by the Z component of the normal to your cut plane, see the following for a derivation:
